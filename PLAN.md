# Aether Framework: Strategic Development Plan

## Executive Vision

**Near-term (6-12 months):** Build the definitive Python platformer framework with exceptional developer experience and comprehensive tooling.

**Mid-term (1-2 years):** Expand to general 2D game development with plugin architecture, enabling community contributions and cross-engine compatibility.

**Long-term (2+ years):** Establish Aether as a code-first alternative to GUI-heavy engines, with interoperability with Unity, Godot, and other platforms.

## Phase 1: Platformer Framework Foundation (Current Priority)

### Immediate Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)
- Complete core platformer systems (variable jump, wall slide, dash, ground detection, one-way platforms)
- Polish physics (slopes, gravity zones, materials)
- Essential tools (ASCII level editor, parameter tuner, debug visualization)

### Proposed Package Structure
```

  core/
  render/

  platformer/
  tilemap/

```

---

## Phase 2: Framework Maturation (Months 2-4)
- Combat and enemy AI
- Progression and inventory
- Moving platforms, hazards, interactivity
- Audio system
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

---

## Phase 3: Community & Extensibility (Months 4-8)
- Plugin architecture (see code samples in full plan)
- Package distribution via pip and optional dependencies
- Contribution, testing, and extension strategy

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Months 8-12)
- Cross-engine/export features (Godot, Unity, Tiled)
- Networking basics
- Advanced rendering, shader support
- Visual editor suite

---

## Development Workflow Strategy
- Intense cycles for new features
- Slow cycles for review, documentation, and planning
- Use devlog and progress tracking rigorously ([see PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md))

---

## Progress Tracking
- Regularly update `PROGRESS.md` with phased checklist

---

## Quality Metrics & Milestones
- Milestones defined for "Platformer Complete", "Framework Release", "Ecosystem Launch", "Production Ready"

---

## Technical Best Practices
- Clear core vs. genre vs. example separation
- API explicitness and config-over-code
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests

---

## Community & Open Source Approach
- Comprehensive documentation (tutorials, guides, contributing)
- Early and continuous sharing for user feedback
- Clear contribution guidelines

---

## Risk Mitigation
- Tightly scoped phases
- Performance profiling and planned Python optimization
- API versioning and stability discipline

---

## Immediate Action Plan (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Finish must-have platformer systems
2. Polish and expand demo/examples
3. Begin reorganization and add runtime tuning/dev tools
4. Set up initial unit/integration tests
